# insomnia-plugin-otp
Auto-generate OTP codes in Insomnia.

Allows you to sign in to any OTP based 2FA API in Insomnia, 
without having to copy-paste from your phone. 
Just create a plugin variable, as one does in Insomnia, 
copy the secret key into the "Secret" field, or use an environment variable,
and voila, you can now sign in without copy pasting an OTP every time.
